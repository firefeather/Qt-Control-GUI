<h1><a class="anchor" name="about">Description and Features</a></h1>Value Browser 3 is the powerful Qt component which allows to edit values represented as a value list (like as Delphi Object Inspector, and so on).<p>
The main features are:<p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-page support</li><li>Item hints</li><li>State flags</li><li>Hierarchical items layout</li><li>Group items</li><li>Special and Own values</li><li>Value lists with auto-completion and auto-appending</li><li>Storing and restoring of value sets</li><li>Quick browser fill</li><li>Binding with external (linked) values</li><li>Import/Export with QSettings</li><li>Highlighting of changes</li><li>Input value validation (numeric, regex and own validators)</li><li>Button editors</li><li>Combo editors</li><li>Extended values and editors (bool, numeric, color, etc.)</li></ul>
<p>
<h3>Multi-page support</h3>
<p>
Value items can be placed onto several pages, and only one page can be displayed at a time.<p>
Page number can be specified in item's constructor. By default, each new item will be placed onto current page.<p>
<h3>Item hints</h3>
<p>
A textual hint can be assigned to every item, thus helping the user to obtain some info about a value being edited.<p>
The "HintChanged" signal is emitted when an item has been selected, which should be connected to a slot showing hint text.<p>
<h3>State flags</h3>
<p>
Each item can contain a check controller (flag), which is accessed in the standard way.<p>
To make an item checkable, you should use setCheckable() method.<p>
<h3>Hierarchical items layout</h3>
<p>
Items could be arranged in the hierarchical way in the list.<p>
Item's hierarchy level can be specified in item's constructor. If the "parent" of the item is <a class="el" href="classTValueBrowser.html" title="Value Browser widget.">TValueBrowser</a> the item will be a top-level item; if the "parent" is another item, then the item will become its "child".<p>
Some of values are itself can contain child items, for example, Color Value provides additional fields for separate input of R,G,B values.<p>
<h3>Group items</h3>
<p>
There could be group items in the list which do not contain values and serve for visual separation of value items' groups.<p>
<h3>Special, List and Own values</h3>
<p>
A pre-defined list(s) of special values can be used for every item (values like "Default", "Unused" and so on).<p>
To set list value, the user can pick appropriate value from one of items specified in the value list which is displayed as a drop-down (combo) box. Also it is possible to type first letters of the desired value to find it in the value list (auto-completion feature).<p>
If allowed, own values (which are not mentioned in the special or value list, and are entered with the keyboard) can be used; also, it is possible to add own values into existing value lists (auto-append feature).<p>
Several value and special value lists can be shared within several list values and value browsers. Such lists could be customized in the application.<p>
<h3>Storing and restoring of value sets</h3>
<p>
Feature allows to quickly store the current state of all (or certain) values including check state with single method call (storeSets()), and later to quickly restore this state by calling restoreSets().<p>
May be useful for configuration dialogs. Typical usage is to connect "storeSets" signal to "Apply" dialog's button and to connect "ValueChanged" signal to the slot used for retrieving data from Value Browser.<p>
<h3>Highlighting of changes</h3>
<p>
When enabled, highlights all the values which have been changed since the last storing.<p>
The way of highlighting can be easily changed in VB's descedants.<p>
<h3>Value validation</h3>
<p>
A <a class="el" href="classTValueValidator.html">validator </a> can be applied to any value item to perform input data validation and not to allow the user to enter invalid value.<p>
<a class="el" href="classTIntValidator.html">Integer </a>, <a class="el" href="classTDoubleValidator.html">Double </a> and <a class="el" href="classTRegExpValidator.html">RegExp </a> validators are supported internally; also, it is possible to create own validators with the custom validation rules.<p>
<h3>Button editors</h3>
<p>
A Button Editor can be applied to any value item editor to input data with custom (pop-up, or so on) editor called by clicking approprite button which should appear near the drop list. Such editor is able to read and write current value in the appropriate way.<p>
TButtonEditor (base class), TPopupButtonEditor (class which introduces small square button with "..." and its on-click handler), TSpinButtonEditor (Button Editor with spin (up-down arrows) control) are available to easily create own button editors by subclassing.<p>
<h3>Combo editors</h3>
<p>
Combo Editor extends standard drop down list and adds the possibility to invoke any external editor as well as choose a value from the list. It adds a special entry to the bottom of the list which invokes external value editor (usually dialog based).<p>
This technique is used in <a class="el" href="classTColorValue.html" title="A color value class which allows to store color values as QColor.">TColorValue</a> item editor - the last position in the drop-down color list is owned by "Pick Color..." item which invokes standard color pick dialog (as well as from button editor).<p>
<h3>Extended values and editors</h3>
<p>
Base values supported by <a class="el" href="classTValueBrowser.html" title="Value Browser widget.">TValueBrowser</a> are <a class="el" href="classTBaseValue.html" title="A base class for items which provide editable values. Internally it provides support...">TBaseValue</a> (for simple editing of string/numbers), and <a class="el" href="classTListValue.html" title="Represents common value item with list support. May be used directly with TItemList...">TListValue</a> (for choosing a value from pre-defined list). Their capabilities are powerful, especially with usage of validators and special editors, hovewer, not enough for some special cases.<p>
There are some additional classes designed for more convenient usage while editing values of another types:<ul>
<li>Boolean Value (introduces check box editor to quickly switch the state);</li><li>Color Value (introduces selection of a color from drop-down list and color dialog);</li><li>Numeric (Integer, Double) Value (introduces spin box editor and makes validation easier);</li><li>Text Value (designed for multiline text input);</li><li>Font Value (designed for choosing a font);</li><li>Point Value (designed for choosing QPoint);</li><li>Size Value (designed for choosing QSize);</li><li>Rect Value (designed for choosing QRect);</li><li>Path Value (for picking path/file names).</li></ul>
<p>
<h3>Binding with external (linked) values</h3>
<p>
Very powerful feature which in connection with Quick Fill and Import/Export can reduce code and thus time to build GUI for data interchange up to 500%.<p>
Every value item can be linked with external value of ordinal (like integer, boolean etc.) or general Qt types (QString, QColor). Once linked, these values can be retrieved/updated/saved/read via single call of corresponding Browser methods.<p>
The common (trivial) approach to data interchange can be generally divided into 5 stages:<ul>
<li>installation of GUI;</li><li>updating of GUI when some data is changed (i.e. retrieving data);</li><li>updating data when GUI is changed (i.e. user has chosen something);</li><li>store data to external location (i.e. when application closes);</li><li>restore data from external location (i.e. on next start).</li></ul>
<p>
Every stage requires a set of tasks which are common for each data item (install/ retrieve/update/save/read). This often takes significant time and needs to write a lot of similar code.<p>
The new approach is called to move all the efforts to install stage only. Every value item gets all the info needed for retrieve/update/save/read. Therefore, other stages can be performed automatically, without need to making something else then single call of the corresponding interchange method.<p>
<h3>Quick browser fill</h3>
<p>
Another powerful feature designed specially for reducing code and design time. Browser introduces a couple of methods (such as addPage(), addGroup(), addInteger() etc.) which allows to install browser GUI very simple and indirectly create value items. These methods also allow to specify pointers to external values and entries for QSettings import/export.<p>
As result, it is now possible to install browser with full item set once (i.e. during construction) and then just use single-called methods to retrieve/update/save/read internal/external values.<p>
<h3>Import/Export via QSettings</h3>
<p>
Browser allows to import/export a set of current, stored and external values via QSettings. This feature reduces time and code for organizing of storing and retrieving of parameters.<p>
In connection with quick fill and bind to external values, it requires only few efforts during setup (i.e. specifying of section and parameter name), and single call for write to/read from QSettings. <!-- footer -->
